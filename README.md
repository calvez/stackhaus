# stackhaus

New Graph QL powered frontend tech stack. Built on Nuxt, using Apollo.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Fonts

This theme uses [webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) for font loading.

If you are using a `@font-face` font, then you will need to put the font files in `/static/fonts`, then define the CSS in `/styles/fonts.css`, the names of the font families in `/web-font-loader.js`, and uncomment the `fonts.css` CSS line and the `web-font-loader.js` plugin line in the `nuxt.config.js` file.

For Typekit or google fonts, please see the [webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) documentation.
