# stackhaus

New Graph QL powered frontend tech stack. Built on Nuxt, using Apollo.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## TODO list

TODO Boilerplate improvements:

-   Get web font loader working: https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader#custom
-   For GA tracking, query WP-GQL for token and set it on client before mounted. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54013335/nuxt-js-how-to-include-an-asynchronous-script-in-the-nuxt-config-js-file
-   Src-set on attachments
-   Meta on posts/pages/attachments/menu items

-   Current page, and all its child pages (for grid pages).

-   Category, and itâ€™s posts (featured image, title, id). Need parent category name and description too.

-   Get page ancestors pages (to build breadcrumbs)
-   Get next/prev post or page (for pagination)
